Dear {%NAME_A%} and {%NAME_B%},

Success! You have been matched by the EA donation swap site.

{%NAME_A%} is from {%COUNTRY_A%}, and wants to support {%CHARITY_A%}. Their email address is {%EMAIL_A%}.
{%NAME_B%} is from {%COUNTRY_B%}, and wants to support {%CHARITY_B%}. Their email address is {%EMAIL_B%}.

If you choose to proceed with your donation swap, here are your instructions:

________________________________________________________________

{%NAME_A%}:

{%NAME_A%} will donate {%ACTUAL_AMOUNT_A%} {%CURRENCY_A%} to the charity {%CHARITY_B%}.
Instructions to donate: {%INSTRUCTIONS_A%}

________________________________________________________________

{%NAME_B%}:

{%NAME_B%} will donate {%ACTUAL_AMOUNT_B%} {%CURRENCY_B%} to the charity {%CHARITY_A%}.
{%GIFT_AID_INSERT_B_TXT%}Instructions to donate: {%INSTRUCTIONS_B%}

________________________________________________________________

This is how the amounts were calculated:

{%CHARITY_B%} recieves {%ACTUAL_AMOUNT_A%} {%CURRENCY_A%} from {%NAME_A%}.
{%GIFT_AID_INSERT_A_TXT%}

{%CHARITY_A%} recieves {%ACTUAL_AMOUNT_B%} {%CURRENCY_B%} from {%NAME_B%}.
{%GIFT_AID_INSERT_B_TXT%}

The exchange rate is currently 1 {%CURRENCY_A%} = {%ONE_CURRENCY_A_AS_B%} {%CURRENCY_B%}.

So {%TO_CHARITY_A%} {%CURRENCY_A%}={%TO_CHARITY_B%} {%CURRENCY_B%}, and both charities receive the same amount of money.
