<p>Hello {%NAME%},</p>
<p></p>
<p>A while ago you used the donation swap website and were matched with {%NAME_OTHER%} to do a donation swap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are conducting an ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of the donation swap tool. We would love if you could fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBUD0ig80KvRoCB6Dtct3XPPKE4vpxrY6Z7v7ZnxnpKgBXug/viewform?entry.2070973991={%OFFER_SECRET%}&entry.797208049={%NAME_OTHER%}+was+going+to+donate+{%AMOUNT_OTHER%}+{%CURRENCY_OTHER%}+to+{%CHARITY%}.+You+were+going+to+donate+{%AMOUNT%}+{%CURRENCY%}+to+{%CHARITY_OTHER%}">short form</a> to help us understand how it worked for you.</p>
<p>The form is pre-filled with the information about your swap, so please leave those fields as they are.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you did more than one donation swap you will get more than one email. We'd really appreciate it if you could fill in the form for each swap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Thanks from the EA donation swap team</p>
