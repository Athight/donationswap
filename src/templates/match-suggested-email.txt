Dear {%YOUR_NAME%},
Youâ€™ve been matched with a compatible donor through the EA donation swap site.

The potential match:
Charity they wish to support: {%THEIR_CHARITY%}
Amount: {%THEIR_AMOUNT%} {%THEIR_CURRENCY%}
(This is around {%THEIR_AMOUNT_CONVERTED%} in {%YOUR_CURRENCY%}.)
This amount may change a little due to currency fluctuations. 

For reference, your offer was:
Charity you wish to support: {%YOUR_CHARITY%}
Amount: {%YOUR_AMOUNT%} {%YOUR_CURRENCY%}
Minimum swap amount: {%YOUR_MIN_AMOUNT%} {%YOUR_CURRENCY%}

If both of you accept the match, you will be donating
{%YOUR_ACTUAL_AMOUNT%} {%YOUR_CURRENCY%} to {%THEIR_CHARITY%},
and they will be donating the same amount ({%THEIR_ACTUAL_AMOUNT%} {%THEIR_CURRENCY%}) to {%YOUR_CHARITY%}.

Please visit https://donationswap.eahub.org/match/#{%SECRET%}
to either approve or decline the donation swap.

Thanks from the EA donation swap team.
