<p>Dear {%YOUR_NAME%},</p>
<p>Youâ€™ve been matched with a compatible donor through the EA donation swap site.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The potential match:</p>
<p>
	Charity they wish to support: {%THEIR_CHARITY%}<br>
	Amount: {%THEIR_AMOUNT%} {%THEIR_CURRENCY%}<br>
	This is around {%THEIR_AMOUNT_CONVERTED%} in {%YOUR_CURRENCY%}.<br>
	This amount may change a little due to currency fluctuations.</p>

<p>For reference, your offer was:</p>
<p>
	Charity you wish to support: {%YOUR_CHARITY%}<br>
	Amount: {%YOUR_AMOUNT%} {%YOUR_CURRENCY%}<br>
	Minimum swap amount: {%YOUR_MIN_AMOUNT%} {%YOUR_CURRENCY%}
</p>
<p>
	If both of you accept the match, you will be donating
	{%YOUR_ACTUAL_AMOUNT%} {%YOUR_CURRENCY%} to {%THEIR_CHARITY%},
	and they will be donating the same amount ({%THEIR_ACTUAL_AMOUNT%} {%THEIR_CURRENCY%}) to {%YOUR_CHARITY%}.
</p>

<p>
	Please visit <a href="https://donationswap.eahub.org/match/#{%SECRET%}" target="_blank">https://donationswap.eahub.org/match/#{%SECRET%}</a>
	to either approve or decline the donation swap.
</p>
<p>Thanks from the EA donation swap team.</p>
