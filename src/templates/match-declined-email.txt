Hello {%NAME%},

We recently sent you an email about a possible match.
Since then, the other donor has declined that match.
We're just letting you know that your match has gone back into the pool.

Here's a link to your match, in case you want to make changes: https://donationswap.eahub.org/offer/#{%OFFER_SECRET%}

Cheers,
